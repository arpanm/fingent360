# SRC-007-ARCHIVE — PIB monthly GDP archive pickup

- **Status:** Done (accepted scope)
- **Parent:** [RESEARCH-AUTO-002](RESEARCH-AUTO-002.md). This completed scope does not complete its broader parent.
- **Implemented:** Verified monthly archive discovery, legacy release identity, retained index/retrieval receipt and original drafts/quarantine with independent review.
- **Specification and source evidence:** Use the dated implementation specification, original-source research and detailed handoff in the parent task. This child makes the finished scope visible in the task index; it does not replace or duplicate that evidence.
- **Layers:** Contracts, API/source persistence, shared web/app workflow and offline behavior are implemented or reused as documented in the parent. Operations requires a connected API. Navigation-only changes reuse existing source APIs and schemas.
- **Authored acceptance:** API1790–1792, WEB1790, OFFLINE1790. Cases cover the specified behavior, not live provider permissions or physical-device acceptance.
- **Migration:** Uses109. No dependency added for this child.
- **Remaining:** User-run validation and applicable source/device activation. Original-data access and wider source coverage remain explicit in the parent.
- **Verification:** Not executed. No format/check/build/E2E, migration, service change, commit or push was run. Baseline a2c53a0.

## Reusable implementation prompt

Read AGENTS.md and the linked parent specification before changing this workflow. Preserve the exact source/identity/unit and review invariants described above. Address a concrete reported gap or saved failing case through contracts, backend, shared web/app and offline behavior as applicable; update authored tests and this record plus TODO. Do not rerun deterministic gates or expand the supported source claim without evidence.

## Manual acceptance

With the documented database/API/web setup and required migrations, run `pnpm sdlc "Validate SRC-007-ARCHIVE" -- --grep "E2E-(API|WEB|OFFLINE)-179[012]"`. Use the web URL printed by `pnpm dev`; keep test watch mode off. Check the corresponding Operations/reader flow documented in the parent. Installed Android/iOS bundles require the documented rebuild/reinstall. Report the exact failed case, saved artifact run and error. The user-operated SDLC command owns gated commit and execution.

## Current acceptance review — 20 September 2026

Reviewed scope: Verified monthly PIB GDP archive discovery, legacy release identity, retained index and retrieval receipts, original drafts and quarantine, independent review and downloaded vintage cutoff admission. Actual source permission and activation, independent operational original review and physical-device release certification remain separate. This does not complete wider parent scope.

The required API, browser-project and offline case IDs are now explicit in [acceptance.json](acceptance.json). Only actual current receipts plus successful normal gates can close this scope. Existing API/contracts/database/source workflows are reused; a matrix correction itself adds no migration or source permission. Physical-device and deployment claims require their separate evidence. The user authorized this validation/repair run; older manual-only handoff wording is historical for this run.

No additional input is needed for this bounded automated scope. Run the complete required matrix and review attached keyboard/narrow-layout artifacts where applicable before claiming accepted delivery.
